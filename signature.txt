   sign/verify) of https://hash-and-sign.github.io.

3. Copy and paste the first four lines of this file (above the double-line) into the lower box (Message to 
   sign/verify) of https://hash-and-sign.github.io -- It doesn't matter what is in the upper box (12 random words).

4. Just below the lower box is a Status message. If the status is "verified" then the PDF has not been altered
